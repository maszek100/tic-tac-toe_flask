tic-tac-toe_flask
=================

Tic Tac Toe using Flask and AngularJS; AI uses minimax algorithm

Library requirements for the project can be found in requirements.txt and installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Easiest and quickest way to get an environment up and running to run the application:<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/jimbach/tic-tac-toe_flask.git`<br/>
`virtualenv --python=/path/to/python3.3/interpreter venv`<br/>
`source venv/bin/activate`<br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
`python3.3 tictactoe.py`<br/>


To run the application:

1. Start the server, `python tictactoe.py` and navigate to localhost:8080 in your web browser (note that js dependencies are loaded from a CDN for this project, so an internet connection is required).
2. A theme (classic Donkey Kong) and other audio clips will play during the game, but the volume can be turned off in the upper right hand corner.
3. To start, simply click anywhere on the board, or allow the AI to make the first move.
4. You can reset the game at any time by clicking the 'Reset' button.

Have fun, and thanks for taking the time to play!
